      <ul>
        <li>
          The 7 Up 7 Down is a game played with three buttons displayed on the
          screen.
        </li>
        <li>
          The three options include less than 7, greater than 7, and equal to 7.
        </li>
        <l1>
          Each player starts the game by placing their chips on one or two of
          these options before the two dice are rolled.
        </l1>
        <li>
          Numbers below 7 (1,2,3,4,5,6) are known as Seven Down. If you win by
          calling a Seven Down, the add up is 1x the balance score.
        </li>
        <li>
          Numbers above 7 (8,9,10,11,12) are known as Seven Up. If you win by
          calling a Seven Up, the add up is 1x the balance score.
        </li>
        <li>
          The number 7 is called a Lucky Seven. If you win by calling a Lucky
          Seven bet, the add up is 4x the balance score.
